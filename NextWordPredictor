But outside of major brands with millions of dollars in funding, literally zero examples come to mind.\nThat’s probably because the purpose of the launch isn’t to put you on the map everywhere but just to get the wheels turning. The hundreds of people who have used my work to become seven-figure business owners have almost always started from scratch, crawled their way to the starting line, launched with moderate success, and grown from there. The launch gave them the momentum they needed to start growing.\nI have a student named Anthony. His first product was a baby carrier. He went from being dead broke, working three jobs at once, having no time for his kids, to launching his first product. Within eighteen months, he was a full- time entrepreneur.\nWhen I tell you that, the assumption I just created is that he had such a good launch that it skyrocketed him to seven figures. That’s not quite how it happens. I often find that people have a misconception, believing that if they get the launch right, they’ll automatically be everywhere. This idea of “one, two, skip a few, launch, you’re a millionaire” isn’t how it happens. The launch is still in the beginning of the process, and now you have to have sales and momentum to be able to grow something.\nRemember, you’re still in “The Grind.”\nAnthony had a fine launch, but his biggest strength was that he was methodical about the process. He had three to five products in mind. He\nstacked the deck. He launched one product, stoked the fire, and carefully repeated the process the same way for products two, three, four, and five.\nYou can’t skip steps and put all your eggs in the launch basket. Success comes from executing upon every little step along the way, not just the flashiest one.\nThe Trillion-Dollar Marketplace\nYou may launch on Kickstarter or use Shopify to fulfill some of your orders, but most entrepreneurs find the best opportunities on Amazon.com. Amazon is the biggest marketplace in the world, and the company is valued at a trillion dollars. It’s important to understand that the process in this book is the same no matter what platform you’re on, but for a beginner there’s really nothing easier or more straightforward than selling on Amazon.\nAs your brand builds momentum after your launch, Amazon will reward you with social proof and free customers. Once you prove that you can bring customers to Amazon, it becomes its own marketing machine, putting you in front of millions of potential buyers. You will start to rank for keywords. You might start to appear on some of their advertising pages for free. You might get a “new release,” “hot new release,” or “bestseller” badge, which will drive up conversions. Lastly, you will start to get reviews, which can make (or break) your brand.\nOne of my students, Nathan, recently surpassed sixty units a day within the first three months of his launch. How? Just by following this process. Why? Because the Amazon marketing machine saw the strength of his activities and turned on in his favor.\nYou’ve probably seen the section on Amazon labeled “frequently bought together.” As your friends and other people buy your product, Amazon starts looking at what they’ve bought before. When this marketing machine kicks in, it shows your product on the listings of other similar products. That’s free advertising.\nThere are a few tricks that you can use to show up more often on Amazon —we’ll cover a few of them in the next chapter—but one mistake people make is allowing Amazon to determine the direction of their business. You have it backward if you’re deciding what products to release based on what\n\nyou think will sell well on Amazon. Build a business for your customers, and let the ease and scale of Amazon handle everything else.\nThe biggest opportunity of selling on Amazon is that the platform rewards momentum. The more momentum you can build, the more that momentum will accelerate. How do you build that momentum? Loving on your audience. Getting reviews. Engaging your customers.\nDon’t discount the supreme importance of speaking directly to the people buying your product. Some people think they can stack the deck with fake reviews on Amazon, bought through review farms. This ploy misses the point. You’re not just trying to get sales; you’re trying to build a brand. If you’re only focused on manipulating the algorithm, then you’re not focused on what matters: your customers.\nThis is why I cringe when people say they have an “Amazon business.” You don’t have an Amazon business. You have a business that takes sales on Amazon.com.\nIt’s easy to compare yourself to other similar businesses that also live on Amazon. As a result, you will be tempted to make your pricing decisions and even your next product releases based on what your direct competitors are doing. One of the most difficult things for a first-time business owner to understand is that competitors don’t matter nearly as much as you think.\nHave you ever seen the picture of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps seconds before he defeats Chad le Clos to win yet another gold medal? Next to him, le Clos is looking at Phelps, watching him beat him by less than half a second. The meme reads, “Winners focus on winning. Losers focus on winners.”\nIn business, you win by going all in on your customers. If you focus on trying to “beat the winner,” the best you can hope for is getting caught up in a price war, which is a race to the bottom. Play your game, let competitors play theirs, and trust the system will take care of itself.\nIn fact, if you’re correctly executing this process, you won’t even be thinking about the competition. You’ll be too busy talking directly to your customers, making sure you have a damn good product, and making sure they have a damn good experience.\n\nDon’t Forget to Reorder\nIn this stage, you’re laser focused on sales, reviews, and making your customers happy.\nWhat happens when you start making all those sales? You use up inventory. And what happens as you go through inventory? If you’re not careful, you go out of business.\nSometimes people are so excited about getting those first sales that they completely forget about reordering. Without product to sell, you’re not running a business. You can’t take sales, and you’re not making any revenue.\nYou should consider reordering much earlier than you think and much sooner than you’re going to feel comfortable. You may think, I have 500 units, and I’m making five sales a day. That means I have 100 days to figure this out.\nThe problem is that the minute a few positive reviews come in and sales jump to ten a day you’ll only have fifty days of inventory left. If you keep doing your job, you’re going to end up with only ten days of inventory left. That number will keep shrinking until it gets to zero.\nThat’s why you want to order as much inventory as you can stomach at the beginning and order inventory again as soon as you’re able. My strategy is to reorder as early as possible, as quickly as possible. A rule of thumb: As soon as you prove your product has life, order the next round of inventory. As soon as your launch is complete or you pass ten sales per day, start queuing up the next order.\nI know that running out of stock is the worst thing that can happen because, as you read earlier, it happened to me. I’d like to say it only happened to me once, but it’s happened in multiple businesses. It sneaks up on you.\nIt was like starting over again each time we ran out of stock. We had to rebuild buzz, and we also lost all the momentum we’d built. I’ve had products that ran out of inventory but got their momentum back in a couple days. I’ve also had products that ran out of stock and never regained that momentum. It’s just not a risk you want to take, so have a plan to ensure that you never run out of stock.\nIf you do happen to blow through your inventory, it’s okay to put people on a waiting list; you just have to perform the process again, and you have to\n\ncommunicate with your customers.\nI once bought a protein cereal that I found on Instagram. After I’d ordered\n—and paid—they sent me an email saying it was back-ordered and would be delayed.\nThat’s not cool.\nIf your inventory is on back order, tell your customers right on the sales page. This information may actually increase sales. Showing you have demand creates social proof, and it may even justify a price hike. If your customers are cool with waiting, you’ll get the sale. If they don’t want to wait, they’re still likely to pay attention when your inventory is in stock again. The key is to let them make their own informed choice, so your brand isn’t tainted with the feeling of a bait-and-switch.\nGo All In on Your Customers\nIt’s exciting to see sales coming in for the first time, and it’s fun to start calculating the amount of money that you might make if you can sustain the growth. However, since you’re in the people business now, you must avoid the critical mistake of thinking it’s all about you.\nYes, you created a cool product, and you worked hard for this, but now your product is in the hands of other people. Those early customers can become raving fans that give you reviews and tell their friends about you, or they can be the reason why your business stalls out. Once you’ve got sales for your product, your job becomes treating those customers like gold, knowing that some of them are going to leave reviews.\nThis is the point where I always get a million questions: How do I get reviews? When do I get them? How many reviews do I need?\nHow many reviews do you need? Zero. Plenty of people made a ton of money before the days of reviews. How many do you want? Simple: as many as you can get.\nThere are multimillion-dollar products out there with thousands of reviews, but there are also multimillion-dollar products with only 100 reviews. Yes, more is technically better, but my philosophy on reviews is that they should confirm a purchase, not be the reason for it. Many Amazon sellers fall into the trap of getting more reviews than “the next guy,” rather\n\nthan focusing on creating great products and treating customers well. Reviews are important, but they are far less important than the rest of the formula for getting to $1 million: three to five products, twenty-five sales a day, at an average price point of $30. With those numbers, you don’t need hundreds of reviews; you need just enough to get past people’s bullshit detectors.\nContinually contributing to the pre-launch community you built is the best way to get buy-in that leads to reviews. Continue to document the growth of your business and the impact your business is making. Continue to bring in the photos that other people post of your product on social media. Take those and highlight them to the rest of your community. By doing this you continue to build up your community.\nCelebrate the reviews you do get. Take screenshots and post them on social media. Send unsolicited gifts to people who leave reviews. Reach out personally to people who talk about your business on social media. Those relationships will create millions of dollars over the long run—go all in on them.\nThat type of commitment and attention to your customers will foster a community that supports you, loves to leave reviews for your product, and eagerly chooses you over the competition.\nThen, once in a while, you can go for the ask: “Hey, we’ve just launched this new product, and we’ve been selling for fourteen days now. We might even run out of stock at this point! But we really need more reviews, to spread the word, to keep pushing this message, and to get more people into yoga [or CrossFit or sunglasses or eating pineapple—whatever your group is into]. If you have used the product, and you love it, please consider leaving us a review on Amazon [or on Shopify, or Walmart.com, or wherever you’re taking orders].”\nAmazon’s search results are highly driven by conversion rate, not reviews. Reviews impact conversion rate, but conversion rate is what matters. Here’s the beauty of this: In theory, if you have more positive\n \nreviews than the next person, you’ll make more sales, have a higher conversion rate, and rank higher. However, if you have an audience that chooses you over everyone else, your conversion rate is going to be higher even if you don’t have a ton of reviews. Having a responsive audience drives up your conversion rates, which drives up your position on Amazon.\nReaching a few dozen reviews during your first few months means you have enough reviews to get to twenty-five or thirty sales a day. You might not have a million-dollar product, but you’ll have enough to get to twenty- five sales a day, which is your only goal before you repeat the entire process. Remember, all you need is twenty-five sales a day. Keep your focus tight, and when you get to the point where you’ve proven your product has enough action in the marketplace, roll out products two, three, and four. Then you continue the journey to $1 million.\nYou might find, however, that a product launch done well takes you straight to the million.\nThat’s what happened to my friend Cathryn Lavery, co-founder of BestSelf Co., a company that helps people become more efficient, focused, and productive—in short, their best selves. Cathryn wasn’t intending to start the business she did; it came about as an unintended result of scratching her own itch.\n“At the time, my partner and I had our own businesses,” she said, “and we started an Amazon business on top of everything. We didn’t care at all about that Amazon business—we were selling random stuff, salt and pepper shakers, nothing that mattered to us. We were spread way too thinly. We were just looking for a framework to help us get everything done. We both wrote things down in Moleskine notebooks, and we liked to nerd out together on how we’d plan our days out. Eventually we realized that we could design our own productivity framework into something much more beautiful and functional. I designed it, Allen made a prototype, and we decided to launch.”\n \nCathryn immediately wanted to launch on Kickstarter, but Allen disagreed. “He wanted to do a product launch formula, but I wanted to do Kickstarter, so we compromised and did a product launch that turned into a Kickstarter.\n“Crowdfunding is incredible because there’s a time limit. People see something they want—your product, or the idea of your product—and they see a clock that tells them we need this much money by this countdown or you’re not getting this thing you want. Kickstarter also has shoppers who just back products on the platform. They have 15 million backers, and more than a third of those are repeat backers who come back and back and back to promote products.”\nProduct development for Cathryn, like any other brand, was a long journey with a lot of changes. “We listened carefully to what our customers were saying. We gave journals away for free and took feedback on how it worked for users,” she said. “When people get to be a part of development, they feel ownership over it, and they feel part of the success of the company.”\nCathryn also stacked the deck with an email list she’d been compiling for three months, through content she’d been putting out on Medium.com. When launch day on Kickstarter came, they had the incredible luck of getting tweeted by Arianna Huffington as a boost to their name recognition.\nTheir Kickstarter for the BestSelf Co. SELF journal was funded in a scorchingly fast twenty-two hours. Part of the success was how they priced their funding levels to get Kickstarter’s platform boost. “The Kickstarter algorithm prefers number of pledges over total amount pledged,” Cathryn said. “So, for instance, if you have ten pledges of $500, and someone else has a thousand pledges of $5, you’ve raised the same amount of money, but the other company will have gotten far more attention. We used this to our advantage. We had a one-dollar reward level on our project, and it skyrocketed us onto the platform.”\nEarly-bird rewards are also a huge hack to get more exposure. “The secret to funding fast is to set up early-bird rewards that equal your funding goal. People love getting rewarded for getting in first, and you get funded fast, look successful, and the algorithm loves you. We set it up so we only needed 200 early backers to hit our whole goal. We got it in two days. It’s not that many people.”\nKickstarter’s organic traffic is a huge boost, which is why Cathryn and\n\nAllen put so much focus on getting momentum on the platform. One-third of all backers on their project were organic hits from people just browsing Kickstarter—eyeballs BestSelf Co. didn’t have to do anything to get.\nAfter the launch on Kickstarter, they put a “Preorder” button on the Kickstarter page, to which they were running no traffic, doing no extra work. Cathryn looked at the analytics a few days later and realized that the sales were three times what they were doing on Amazon in an entire month.\nShe called Allen and told him she couldn’t bring herself to go back to the Amazon business and that she wanted to focus on BestSelf Co. He agreed.\n“Great, we’ll shut that business down,” she said.\n“Um, no,” he replied. “We’ll sell it.” (No need to burn the house down on the way out the door.)\nThey went all in on BestSelf Co. and their Kickstarter campaign. Then Cathryn and BestSelf Co. got noticed by Daymond John, of FUBU and Shark Tank. BestSelf Co. went from mid–six figures to a million-dollar business in seven months, and that scaling had nothing to with Kickstarter. “We expanded our product range,” she said. “We realized that the people who would buy their journal would buy other things to help them with productivity. We remembered watching Shark Tank and thinking about some of the businesses we saw—that’s not a business, that’s a product. We never wanted to be that, so we’ve been focused on diversifying ever since.”\nCathryn’s story demonstrates that if you have a great product, you are good to your customers, and you stack the deck toward a great launch, you eventually hit pay dirt, even if it’s not in the way that you first imagined.\nHalfway to a Million\nAt this point in the process, I like to tell entrepreneurs that they are halfway to their first million. They never believe me. Never. So, allow me to take a moment to tell you how far you’ve already come: You are halfway to your first million.\n“How could that be?” you ask. “We just started taking sales for our product! I am not doing half a million dollars right now!”\nAt the moment, that may be true, but you’ll be shocked at how fast the snowball starts rolling at this point. Your journey so far has been making\n\ndecisions, getting your product ready, and taking an order. You’ve been in The Grind. Now we enter The Growth period, where your sales start to compound. While everyone is different, many entrepreneurs get to their first million just six months from this point.\nThat means that you might be halfway to your first million after all.\nA few months ago, you hadn’t even begun your journey. Maybe you didn’t even know what you wanted to sell. Now, you’ve launched, you’re taking sales, and you will soon be getting repeat customers and referrals, too.\nYou can actually build a million-dollar business.\nI’ve seen people pace $1 million after one or two products quite quickly. They go live. Then within three or four months they have 100 sales a day, which means they’ve crossed that $1 million threshold.\nIt can happen that fast, but everybody starts at zero. Everyone starts by doubting themselves. Everybody wonders if it’s going to work. If you stick with this process, stay devoted to your customers, and watch the power of compounding returns take hold, you can build a million-dollar business, as hundreds of my students have. You might even build a billion-dollar business.\nBut wait, forget a billion dollars—how do you get those twenty-five sales, every single day? Keep reading to find out.\n Entrepreneur Spotlight: Kevin Pasco and Jeremy Sherk\nKevin Pasco and Jeremy Sherk co-founded Vancouver-based Nested Naturals in late 2013. The company launched in the summer of 2014 with two products: Luna, a natural sleep aid, and a Canadian maple syrup.\nAt first, Kevin and Jeremy planned to sell health foods as well as supplements—but building a brand around both maple syrup and sleep aids was proving difficult. After looking at the sales numbers, they quickly decided to focus solely on supplements.\nThey bootstrapped the company with loans from family. From his\n\n mother, Jeremy got an initial $10,000 loan that went into upfront costs —mainly purchasing inventory, but also for label design and building the company website. Once they began to grow, Kevin’s mother loaned the company another ten grand.\nKevin and Jeremy were focused on one guiding mission for their products: quality ingredients. They wanted honest, transparent products that were natural, organic, and non-GMO. No artificial ingredients, ever. This would become the core of their branding—even if they had no idea at the time.\nThe first sale of their Luna sleep aid happened the first day it was put up on Amazon. Kevin and Jeremy’s reaction to a single sale? They were ecstatic.\n“Holy shit! Someone actually bought the thing that we just worked seven months on! That’s what we kept saying,” Kevin told me. “Even though we’d obviously been working toward that goal, to have it actually work seemed crazy to us.”\nThe climb to greater sales was slow at first because the product didn’t have a built-in audience and no advertising was put into promoting it. The partners just threw Luna up on Amazon and their website, taking it one day at a time.\nThey had a lot of help in the beginning. Jeremy joined my small mastermind group, which helped remove the unknown. It added to the good foundation of knowledge Jeremy had from being well versed in internet marketing, online business, and marketing in general. He went into Nested Naturals prepared to do the work, to do whatever it took to make it successful. And with that mindset, success came more quickly than he planned.\nIt was that ethos and mindset—and staying true to their values— that helped make Nested Naturals what it is today, generating fans and customers who supported the brand.\nAs they grew, Kevin and Jeremy experimented with different ways of building a social audience: They offered coupons, put a URL on their product bottles, and did anything they could to drive customers back to their website. When they got customer information or got them on their email list, they personally followed up.\nOne of their biggest early problems was running out of stock,\n\n which happened half a dozen times. The partners were only able to order as much product as they could pay for at the time, which led to overselling—all part of the growing pains of a bootstrapped business. Negotiating terms with suppliers was tough, and it was even tougher when inventory that was supposed to last two months sold out in half that time.\nDespite these growing pains, things got better and moved faster as the company continued to iterate through repeated sales cycles. Eventually, it had enough cash reserves to order as much inventory as needed. “Three months in, we had a lot more sales than we’d anticipated,” Kevin told me. “We were getting probably one or two dozen orders a day.”\nThe company generated a million dollars in revenue the first year, mostly from sales of Luna. By the ninth or tenth month, sales had reached a couple thousand dollars a day.\nKevin and Jeremy found themselves in an odd, relatively rare position: They’d always wanted to have a brand with multiple products, but Luna did so well they couldn’t keep up with its growth at first, much less launch other products.\n“We realized we had to completely shift our mindset to get the company on track,” Jeremy said.\nThe partners had originally intended to split net profits in half. They realized their business would never grow if they didn’t reinvest what they made, especially since they didn’t want to take on outside investment. So they buckled in for a lean journey. They each took $2,000 a month out for the first year—just enough to barely survive. They put everything else they had into launching more products and making them work, even if it meant a year of living like monks.\nThe company’s second product was Super Greens, a greens powder used to make nutritional drinks. They put a lot of focus on label design to establish the Nested Naturals brand and turn it into a company offering a variety of natural supplements. The approach, which was probably more labor-intensive than absolutely necessary, was for each product to have its unique branding, label, and colors. Each product was like its own brand, with a different look and feel, essentially. Doing different designs for different products got people’s\n\n attention.\nDown the road, however, this became a problem. People thought\neach product was from a different company. Even people who knew the partners thought Nested Naturals had started selling for other companies. A switch to a unified brand had to be made.\nKevin was afraid there would be customer pushback on the change, but there wasn’t a single complaint. “The lesson we learned there is that no one micro-analyzes and overthinks branding more than a company’s owners,” Kevin said. “Branding is important, but your customers aren’t going to sweat it as much as you do.”\nIt wasn’t until the company was doing $2.5 to $3 million a year that the partners decided to build out an office and hire employees. They wanted to do what they needed to do to grow bigger and faster. Traditional retail supplement brands generally have up to 500 products, and they were still only selling ten.\nA former-competitor-turned-friend, who was also the first person the partners met in my mastermind group, gave the partners some great advice: “You can’t do it alone.”\nKevin and Jeremy started hiring. They discussed but decided against a remote team, opting to set up office space. “Having everyone in one place makes for better communication and culture, as well as greater employee investment in the company,” Jeremy said. “It was the right move, but the costs were huge.”\nThey tried to keep exorbitant Vancouver rents at bay by setting up their office in a hundred-year-old building, rather than in one that had just been built.\nNevertheless, the company plateaued during the first year after opening its office doors. Sales didn’t increase at all. Kevin attributed this to a loss of focus. “We were all over the map that year,” he said. “Should we go into retail? Wholesale? Sell on Facebook? We needed to get back to basics.”\nOnce they refocused on their core competency, selling natural supplements on Amazon, the company started growing again. Now, three years later, they have grown to four times the size, pulling in a million dollars in revenue each month, with a staff of fifteen, in addition to several contractors who work remotely.\n\n According to Kevin, there are things you can and should do when starting out that can’t be done once you get bigger. You can test things out, change your branding, and even change your name. “Focus on getting things right when you start out so that you can then scale smoothly, as opposed to growing as quickly as possible as early as possible,” he said.\nIt’s equally important to make sure you have someone to handle inventory by the time you expand your line from one item to ten. This could be a part-time contractor at first, as long as they have the right experience. And, when starting out, don’t just chase after revenue. A lot of things can start to break and go wrong once you begin selling more. When you’re properly set up to scale, you can focus much more exclusively on selling more and more product.\nIt’s important, too, to be careful once you start to succeed. “You start looking at ways you can spend money to grow the business,” Jeremy said. “That’s when you’re going to make mistakes if you’re not careful.”\nOnce you can afford it, you start feeling there’s a lot of help out there to take advantage of, but that’s not always the case. “We went down the wrong road with influencers in particular, thinking, OK, let’s throw ten grand at influencers and see what happens. Of course, it’s going to work,” Jeremy said. “It was probably the biggest mistake we ever made. We got maybe $100 total back in sales.”\nWhat Kevin and Jeremy have discovered is that the best way to grow their business is to stay as lean as possible. With rare exceptions, they’ve resisted trying to buy their way to growth. They’ve focused on earning their growth by being as strategic as possible and really thinking issues through.\nKevin and Jeremy are still 50/50 partners and are as excited as ever to be running the company. They believe there’s a lot of growth to be had. Each quarter is a fresh quarter, bringing new, exciting initiatives. They have an amazing team in Vancouver that oversees the nuts and bolts of the business, so they’re less hands-on than before, but they’re still fired up for the business. With more personnel, things move a bit more slowly, but the business is still nimble and adaptable. Even today, things change at a rapid pace.\n\n Jeremy is just excited to be a part of it. “In the years I’ve been running my brand, a lot of my peers have started and sold companies, maybe even multiple times,” he said. “But Kevin and I were never looking for a quick buck or a quick exit.”\nThey believe they can reach new levels with this business, which will ultimately create a bigger exit down the line—though they don’t have a timeline for that. As long as their hearts are still in it and they believe there’s more success on the horizon, they’re still 100 percent invested. In fact, instead of looking to be acquired, they’re interested in investing and acquiring other companies. There are many different pathways in the entrepreneurial game. The key is to get going, according to Jeremy and Kevin.\n“Winners start and move toward something,” Kevin said. “Losers are paralyzed by inaction.”\n\n8\nStep Six: Growing to Twenty-Five Sales a Day\nIn the wake of the 2008 economic crash, women and men in their twenties watched the corporate life they’d been sold come crashing down. As a result, aspiring entrepreneurs across the globe sat unfulfilled, chained to desks. The economy was flat, and the “old way” to success had collapsed, which stirred entrepreneurial desires among millions of young people itching to go out on their own.\nOne of those twenty-somethings was Aubrey Marcus. Like most hustlers, he tried his hand at a few entrepreneurial ventures, and he threw things at the wall to see what would stick. His first attempts: sex toys and hangover supplements.\nNeither gave him success or internal fulfillment.\n“I wasn’t ready,” he said, looking back.\nAlthough his attempts didn’t lead him to the freedom he sought, they did\nshow him how to create a product, how to sell, and how to advertise. The process also helped him network with others who could help him along the way. That’s what led him to a lunch meeting with Joe Rogan.\nIn the early days of Joe’s podcast (now downloaded more than 200 million times per month), Aubrey advertised his sex toys on the show, becoming one of Joe’s biggest sponsors.\n  \n“I asked Joe what he was into,” Aubrey recalled. “And he said, ‘I’m really into nootropics right now.’ I told him that I would create the best in the world.”\nWhat he didn’t tell Joe was that he had no idea what a nootropic was. But he promised Joe that he would develop the best one in the world.\nAubrey was soon down the product-research rabbit hole, reading studies and testing ingredients, until he ultimately formulated the brain supplement Alpha Brain.\nHe gave some of the newly released Alpha Brain to Joe, who loved it so much that he agreed to partner with Aubrey on the new project, named Onnit. As a new owner, he also agreed to talk about it on the podcast. As a result, Joe brought Alpha Brain to his millions of subscribers on a weekly basis. The product quickly sold out, and Aubrey had to scramble to order more inventory.\nAubrey is a perfect example that success often follows major failures. Failure has a way of opening new doors that you didn’t see before. Even if your first attempt doesn’t go the way you want, it can pave the way for your big breakthrough.\nOnce the product was back in stock, Joe talked about it on the podcast, and it sold out again. This cycle continued until the company raised a small amount of money to keep up with the growth.\nThere was no vision for an empire; it was pure entrepreneurial drive. “I was just desperate to make something happen,” Aubrey said.\nBefore long, Alpha Brain was the best-selling brain-enhancing supplement ever. It created a category all on its own—natural nootropics. The company, however, was based on the success of just one product. The company was growing, and the profit margins were high, but Aubrey knew he needed to release more products if he wanted to be a real brand.\n  \n“It wasn’t until then,” Aubrey explained, “that I had a vision for what I was doing and why I was doing it.”\nOnnit soon released New Mood, a serotonin booster made to calm down the brain and help to manage stress, and Shroom Tech, a blend of earth- grown mushrooms.\nThen the company started selling kettlebells. And battle ropes. And medicine balls. Then food, protein powder, and nut butters.\nThe company went hard into podcast advertising, and it worked well for them. They gained national exposure, and it wasn’t long before their t-shirts were seen in gyms all over the country. Then they opened a gym.\nInstead of settling as a brain-optimization company, Aubrey sprinted full- throttle into becoming a total human optimization company. That included brain, body, and mind. Today, the Onnit headquarters in Austin, Texas, is buzzing with jujitsu classes, a full cafe, and more than 100 employees. They continue to be mentioned on the Joe Rogan Experience and many other podcasts, and they have a raving fan base around the globe.\nThink about a series of products that serve the same person: That’s the power of a brand.\nWelcome to The Growth\nFew people understand how powerful it is to take an idea from scratch, bring it to life, and make a sale. This is why I say entrepreneurs are the most powerful people on the planet; we literally make things up, make them real, and sell them to other people.\nProving you can take an order for a new product validates your idea. It proves it’s real. Then it becomes your job to turn that into a machine that now creates predictable sales.\nYour entire focus in this stage of the process is to create a stream of sales that regularly churns out at least twenty-five sales per day of your product. You do that by continuing the momentum you created by going all in on your customer: getting excellent reviews, responding to every comment, thanking your customers, connecting with influencers, and continually stoking the fire on a one-to-one basis. Doing all this will get you the reviews, exposure, publicity, and word-of-mouth advertising you need to hit the twenty-five-\n\nsales-per-day mark.\nWhen you have a consistent twenty-five sales per day, you have a\nmachine that can be applied to more products. At that point, you will release multiple products into the machine, and your business will surge past 100 sales per day, giving you the million. Yes, it can happen that quickly.\nBut first, we need to build that machine through The Growth. To get there, we need a process to turn a few customers into many.\nHow Big Can You Go?\nWhen Matt and I first started selling our Sheer Strength products, one of my coaches asked me, “How big do you want the business to go?”\nI’ll be honest; the first thing that popped into my head was: What kind of a question is that? Huge, obviously. Astronomical. World-obliteratingly massive.\nBut I came up with a concrete answer. “A hundred sales a day,” I said. “That would be a million-dollar business.”\n“What are you at now?” he asked.\n“Five sales a day.”\nThis was way back before Amazon was the behemoth it is today. This\nwas also before automation tools and “influencers” were a thing; we did most of our marketing by hand. We called our customers. We talked to our friends, asked them what they thought, and begged for a review if they liked it. We did whatever we could to get reviews, and we celebrated every time a new one came in.\nA hundred sales a day sounded like a pipe dream to me at the time.\nNo one comes out of the gate with a consistent stream of sales; it has to be built.\nIt’s not uncommon to start with twenty to twenty-five sales a day during launch, only to see them come to a screeching halt once you squeeze every drop of juice out of your launch lemon. To keep that initial momentum going, you need reviews, testimonials, and good old-fashioned advertising; you’re going to have to stoke the fire again and again for the next few months—and then strategically launch your follow-up products.\nGetting to twenty-five sales a day is not super difficult; the prep to get\n\nthere is. The good news is you’ll have completed most of that by this point. From here, every inch forward creates a compounding return because you begin to experience repeat customers, you have a list and a process, and the whole operation starts to become a machine. Without this prep, however, you can get stuck on how far you are from the magic number and lose hope.\nThere’s no algorithm for going from five to twenty-five sales a day. It’s about building relationships with people, building trust with your customers, and building awareness in the marketplace. That’s a brand.\nWhen Matt and I were doing our own customer support with Sheer Strength, grinding it out and doing whatever we needed to do to get a review, we were totally lost. Calling customers is putting oneself out there in a big way, and it was scary. But that’s also part of being an entrepreneur. We were just willing to outwork everyone who tried to get in the game at the same time as us.\nOne of my employees once reflected on those early times. She said about me, “When I started working with him, I thought he was this entrepreneur who had all the answers to everything. Then, about a year ago, I realized that Ryan has no idea what he’s doing.”\nOkay, that’s a little harsh.\nIt’s also basically true.\nWe are all winging it in life, and in business, to some extent.\nWe all think everybody else has it all figured out—and, believe me, no\none does. At best, we’re all competent at a few things and guessing our way through everything else.\nYou don’t know what’s going to happen when you release a product to the marketplace. You don’t know what’s going to happen when you call a customer. You do know that, at some point, you’re going to get hateful comments on Facebook, and you’re just going to have to get over it. You can ignore it, or you can play with it. Consider having fun with it; after all, it’s a sign of success.\nYou will get a negative review, and it will hurt. It will make you want to quit. It will also hurt your sales. It’s all part of the process. Look at it as data gathering. If you’re too afraid of a few haters to build up a Facebook group, you’re really going to suffer when it comes to growing the business past five or ten sales a day.\nWhen I was in college, I planned on becoming a pastor. My professors in\n\ncollege prepared me to be ready for criticism. Sure, they meant while we were talking from the pulpit, but products aren’t that different. Not everyone is going to like you or what you put out into the world. Someone will always be upset over something you said. It just comes with the territory.\nThat’s not to say that every call I made to a customer ended in angry tirades or tears. Occasionally they’d be pissed, but nine times out of ten, people were blown away. Even the people who angrily asked, “Why are you calling me?” were taken aback a bit when I responded with, “I’m the founder of the company, and I just want to ensure you had a five-star experience.”\nThat little touch—showing that I was already on the phone, genuinely interested in hearing about their experience—was enough to tip the scales.\nAddicted to Feedback\nThere may be no formula or magic potion that guarantees sales growth, but I have found certain milestones do lead to a bump in sales. For example, you will see a major bump when you cross twenty-five positive reviews. And you’ll see a bigger bump when you cross the 100-review mark because that means you’re the real thing. There is something about seeing 100 people approve your product that crosses the bullshit detector in people’s brains.\nThose first twenty-five to fifty reviews can be enough to get you over the twenty-five-sales-a-day mark. A hundred will almost certainly do it; every market is a little bit different, but that’s when you have enough in the marketplace to be legit, which often leads to a big spike in sales.\nAgain, everybody wants a formula for how long it takes to get more sales and to hit those milestones, but it’s just not predictable. You just have to do the work. The first time I launched a product, it took me about three months to get to twenty-five sales a day. Now I can do it in about fourteen to thirty days because my customer list is bigger, I have thousands of repeat customers, and my process is more dialed in. You’ll get there, too.\nWhen a customer purchases your product, you can follow up with him or her in one of two ways. One option is to reach out and say, “Hey, I hope you liked the product. Could you please leave us a review?”\nPass. She has better things to do, dude.\nThe second option is to say, “Hi, Natalie. Did your order arrive on time? I\n\njust wanted to make sure it got there when it was supposed to.”\nThat’s a give. That’s a deposit into the relationship bank account.\nWhen Natalie replies that it did, you follow up again: “Great, thanks so\nmuch for the feedback. I just credited $10 to your account as a thank-you for letting me know. Is there anything else we should know about the brand? What would you like to see us release next?”\nNatalie is thinking, Damn, this company is AMAZING.\nNow you’re in an exchange. You’re building a relationship. You’re giving the customer something they love—value, and the thrill of feeling special—but getting so much more in return. Always go for the give.\nFrom there, if your customer gives you feedback or a great idea, keep going: “Hey, that’s great to hear. Thanks so much for the kind words. If you feel like sharing about your experience, we would love your feedback in the form of an Amazon review.” That’ll do it, every time.\nWhen a customer does leave you feedback, screenshot it and post about it on Instagram. Publicly celebrate it. Show the community that you are listening. Your job at this point is to make your customers addicted to giving you feedback. They don’t just like your product; they love giving you reviews. They love supporting a company that’s so involved in their community.\nWhat If I’m Stuck at Ten Sales per Day?\nYou’re going to get stuck at times.\nSome get stuck around ten sales per day. They launch, get to twenty-five\nsales a day, then have pullback. They start thinking, I don’t know what to do now. They start worrying about numbers and algorithms and stop being curious about the process and the people behind the purchase. They don’t open up customer loops. They don’t think, Who are my people, and where are they hanging out? Instead, they figure, Well, my product must not be good enough; guess I better go find another product to launch.\nThey spend all that time stacking the deck, building up an audience for a launch, and then they just walk away because it’s not an instant success. Or, even worse, they think, I don’t understand. My product is better than everybody else’s. It deserves more sales. Why aren’t people buying it in\n\ndroves?\nJust because you think your product is better than anything else on the\nmarket doesn’t mean it will outsell everyone else. That’s not how it works. Any idiot (and I’m not calling you the idiot!) can throw a product up for sale on a place like Amazon and start to get ten sales a day. And that idiot can buy reviews from cheap Chinese accounts until he or she gets caught and banned (yes, I know many people who have done this). It takes the willingness to keep grinding, being in the weeds, and cultivating a following to grow to twenty-five sales per day and beyond.\nIf you plateau, your temptation is going to be to think bigger. I recommend you do the opposite—go super micro. Remember my advice to Ken? What can you do this week to get ten more reviews? What can you do this week to blow a customer away? What can you do this week to motivate your following? Who can you contact this week who might talk about you publicly?\nI have students who get a bump in sales every time they talk about their product on their own personal Facebook page because they’re communicating with a different set of people. They highlight a different feature about the product, or they simply hit people at the right time. Sometimes, doing the small things for long enough is all it takes.\nThere are a few things that you can “turn up” to increase sales, though.\n1. Use Amazon’s pay-per-click platform. Amazon allows you to advertise within its own search results, which is extremely effective and expensive. You may have to spend more money acquiring the customer than you reap in profit, which means you’ll be operating at a loss. However, you’ll build your review machine, acquire new customers, and continue feeding the algorithm. In this case, it’s better to take sales at zero profit than to take no sales at all.\n2. Run video ads on Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube. If you decide to go this route, I recommend starting with customer testimonials as your first test. You can never sell your product better than other customers can. It’s fast to test different messages and ads, so test several approaches until one of them clicks.\n\n3. Put attention back into building your community. Turn your attention away from sales and instead put it into your community. Go back to the customer and what they want. Go back to stacking the deck. You can do a “re-launch” if you feel called to. The important thing is to return to interacting with your potential customers.\nI have a student—name withheld for reasons that are about to become obvious—who is in the pet supplies business. He launched his first product and initially did well, but then he got stuck.\nHe’s not his own target demographic, so he doesn’t already know the answers to what his customers want. That’s okay. You can get past that as long as you’re willing to listen closely to your customers. But he stopped caring about the people behind his product, which was his brand’s death sentence.\nHe came to me and said, “I’m stuck. How do I break out of this?”\n“What are you doing now?” I asked.\n“I’m focusing on reviews, I have a really good product, and I’m\nlaunching more products.”\n“Okay,” I said. “Where do your customers hang out so that we can\nadvertise to them?”\n“No idea,” he said.\n“Well, you might want to start by figuring that out.”\nHe didn’t know, and he didn’t care that he didn’t know. He just wanted to\nsell more stuff.\nThose people should be your sole focus as you sprint toward twenty-five\nsales and build your review machine. You want to know who those people are, where you can find them, how you can create the best products for them. Then, if they love your products and brand and the experience you’ve created, maybe they will leave you a review.\nBut, Ryan, What If I’ve Tried Everything and My Brand Still Doesn’t Gain Traction?\nAt this point, some of you are going to be saying, “But I’ve done all of that— I’ve done all of the things, and I’ve done them well—and it’s still failed to\n\ngain traction. Why, Ryan, why?”\nHonestly, I can’t tell you why—but your customers can.\nIf you ask them, they will tell you. Reach out to your most active\nfollowers and customers and ask for feedback.\n“Do you want this? Would you buy this? Why or why not?” And then\nyou need to listen.\nI’m working with a company right now, and I happen to be their target\nmarket, so they sent me their product: a low-calorie fruit powder. It tasted good, looked good, and should have been a good product. But, as a customer, I had a big problem: I didn’t understand how to use their product. It’s not that I couldn’t figure out the powder. I just had no idea when I would prefer to use this powder instead of regular, plain old fruit. (“Stir it in yogurt!” Fruit. “Add it to smoothies!” Frozen fruit. “Just add water!” Um, why?)\nI gave this feedback to my contact at the company, and, instead of listening, he told me why I was wrong. He gave me a rational, intellectual breakdown of why I—the customer—just didn’t understand the product.\n“Dude,” he said emphatically, as though if he just said it another way I would finally grasp the concept. “It replaces fruit!”\nI still can’t figure out why I’d want that.\nSomeday, he’ll get it. He’ll have a great launch because he’s got a big audience. The product will sell. People will be excited to try it, and then it’s going to head to the back of their cupboard, where they’ll never touch it again.\nIf your product fails to gain traction, despite your steps to do everything right, then it’s likely that something went wrong in the initial stages. Entrepreneurs are big thinkers, but they often think too big at this stage in the process. Go back to the customer, to the following. Focus on the micro.\nMaybe you didn’t get enough people in one spot. We’ve talked about needing to create a place that has at least 1,000 followers talking about the product. Maybe you tried one thing on Instagram, and something else on Reddit, and then a third thing on your YouTube channel. Now you have a lot going on, and it may seem like everyone is talking about your product, but you still don’t have 1,000 people in one place.\nI have a student named Michael who sells products for gardeners. During the stack-the-deck phase, Michael went all in on a Facebook group; he doesn’t have an Instagram following, and he’s not on any other platform. He\n\njust focused on building that Facebook group and now has 14,000 gardeners all in one place. He can launch whatever he wants and get all the feedback he needs. As a result, he can also earn whatever profit he wants.\nWhat did he do to get those 14,000 leads? He created a community that was responsive and helpful, and people invited their friends. Now the group grows by hundreds of people each week without him lifting a finger. He promotes his product in cool and ethical ways within the group, and his community rewards him for it.\nI’m Making Twenty-Five Sales a Day! What Do I Do Now?\nFirst of all: Congratulations! You’ve built a machine that can support a million-dollar business.\nNow what?\nEasy: It’s time to repeat the process. Get ready for launch number two, and then three, and then four, and then five.\nIn fact, you never stop repeating the process. You go back to where all your customers showed up, and you engage even more.\nPeople often ask me, “If I do everything right, what percentage of my first-launch customers should I expect to come back and be repeat customers?”\nIf you did everything right, this answer is easy, too: all of them.\nAll those people who love your first product and who had a great experience with you and your company will come back and buy product number two. If you do this right—if you create those leads, if you talk to them and listen to them, and do all the people-oriented things we’ve talked about so far—you can expect return buyers.\nThe process for launch two is just warming up all of those previous customers so that you have an even bigger launch the second time around. In fact, it should be even easier now as there’s no ramp-up process for product number two. While you worked hard and put all your time into launching the first product, product two will come more easily. You’re simply engaging more with what the customers who have already purchased from you want.\n\nSo, you can skip the stacking-the-deck process and double down on the people who are already there.\nYou’re in the home stretch, really. Now we sprint to the million.\nDo you remember Travis and Jenna Zigler, the optometrists I talked about earlier? Their brand is called Eyelove, and they did a fantastic job of paying attention to their customers. They do Q&As with their customers and actually listen to the questions and feedback they get. They regularly do Facebook Live events to interact with all their raving fans as well.\nTheir products have higher price points, but every time they launch a new product, they go from zero to fifty sales a day within a few weeks. People leave reviews, and it snowballs. That focus gave them the machine that has now built a multimillion-dollar business.\nWhen you finally hit that magic number of twenty-five sales a day, it’s time for you to start building your snowball, too. It’s time to choose product two. Let’s look at how exactly to do that.\n Entrepreneur Spotlight: Jason Franciosa\nJason Franciosa was coming off a failed business and searching online for what to do next when one of my ads popped up on his screen. Immediately intrigued, he decided to join my community at Capitalism.com.\nAfter learning my method, Jason dove right in and launched his company, Element 26.\nJason and his business partner, who is a doctor in physical therapy, looked at a bunch of ideas for products. In the end, they came to exactly where Matt and I had ended up with Sheer Strength: They targeted themselves as the customer.\nThey were both avid weightlifters. The fastener on their weight belts always failed over time.\n“It was pretty obvious what product to put out first,” Jason told me.\nThey knew that the true key to success with this product would be\n\n doing something different. They weren’t alone in their struggles with Velcro. When they looked at all the biggest weight belt competitors, and read online reviews, the theme of failed Velcro was consistent and clear.\nThey set out to design the best, most functional weightlifting belt possible, while solving that main problem: How do you fix the Velcro?\nThey reached out to manufacturers and got a variety of samples. They looked at using buckles, clasps, and a clip with teeth that dug into the belt. They got prototypes of about five different solutions and tested them. They also considered what type of material they would use. The width of the belt, the shape, all of it came under scrutiny—all while sticking to their core values as a company of functional products for functional athletes. No marketing gimmicks.\nThey finally settled on a self-locking buckle, a slide lock that actually supports the entire pressure of the belt as opposed to the Velcro. When they launched and marketed the product, they focused on the problem their belt would solve—the failing Velcro. By understanding what their audience was looking for, Jason and his partner centered all their marketing material on the design difference between their belt and others. It helped them stand out and eat away at the competition’s sales, while still keeping their prices high. It also helped shape their reputation and started to build their brand within the space.\nJason attributed a lot of his success to his product being different, and in bringing an obvious improvement to a well-used product in the CrossFit and weightlifting communities. But he also benefited from relationships with influencers.\nWhen it comes to influencers, Jason found cold calling ineffective —unless you just want to pay for a post. “The best way is to meet people in person by going to events, having a handshake, providing some sort of value to the influencer,” he said. “Especially if you can understand what they care about and make that personal connection.”\nIt’s even better if you can bring the influencers into the development cycle, which is what Jason and his partner are trying to do now. “As you build new products, the influencers give input. What\n\n this ends up doing is creating a complete buy-in once the product launches.”\nInfluencer events are great, but going to events in your chosen market is just as important. “At the end of the day, you’re selling to a person,” he said. “Just because they’re behind a computer screen doesn’t change the fact that it’s a person. How can you really know your people if you don’t go to the events where they hang out and meet them face-to-face?”\nJason said they have faced some challenges—the constantly changing Amazon platform, initial design problems, and a change in packaging. The new design looked great, but their manufacturer failed to mention that with the new printing process, there was an odor. Suddenly, they started getting bad reviews about their product’s smell.\nDespite these challenges along the way, they went from zero to $10,000 a month in two months. They consistently grew for a year and a half before focusing on launching new products.\n“Find one product that works, get the cash flowing, and then, as quickly as possible, start testing new products. Double down on products that work great and get rid of products that do not,” Jason said. “If I could have a do-over, I’d be more aggressive with the timeline than we were. As soon as the business is self-sustaining, and there’s no out-of-pocket expenses, you should launch the next product —roughly when you’re selling $10,000 to $15,000 a month on a single product.”\nJason and his partner both had full-time jobs when they first started the business, so their process dragged out a little bit because they were not 100 percent working on the business at the start. As a result, it took them a little longer than twelve months to get to $1 million; instead, they were at a million in twenty-four months. Jason left his job, working full-time on the business. He and his partner are finally at the point where they take an owner’s draw.\n“The money is great,” he said, “but honestly, it’s the freedom, and all the people I’ve met and built relationships with, that makes this fulfilling for me.”\n\n9\nStep Seven: Build a Million-Dollar Brand\nRemember Dave Asprey’s fancy coffee?\nWhen Dave launched his company, Bulletproof 360, in 2013, it quickly became famous for his recommended morning brew: coffee, blended with butter and MCT oil. It was only natural for Dave to launch his own coffee brand of organic, “upgraded” coffee as his first product.\nHe followed up with his own line of butter and MCT oil, which helped him to establish a steady stream of revenue and raving fans. Had he wanted to have a small, profitable coffee company, he could have stopped there.\nBut Dave desired to be more than a coffee company; he had his sights set on becoming the go-to source for upgraded performance. Over the next few years, Dave would release everything from supplements, to sleep induction mats, to a “whole body vibe,” to a $15,000 five-day retreat.\nOf course, it would have been impossible for Bulletproof to do this right out of the gate. They had to crawl before they could run. But with a raving fan base that supports all his products, Bulletproof has the ability to release whatever products Dave is inspired to create.\nJust like Bulletproof, your brand will be defined by the products that you release. Your first product was your gateway; it made it easy for your audience to start their journey, and to choose you as their guide. But to create\n  \na real brand, your follow-up products must lead the customer to the next stage of their journey. These follow-up products will ultimately define what your company becomes; they will also lead you to cross your first million.\nStage Three: The Gold\nWhen our first Sheer Strength product hit twenty-five sales a day, Matt and I were beside ourselves.\nIt was a major milestone. At the same time, we knew it was just the beginning. If we were going to build a million-dollar business, our math told us that, at our price point, we would have to sell four products at twenty-five sales a day to get there.\nAfter hitting twenty-five sales each day consistently, our product leveled off. You’re always going to hit a plateau. Luckily, that plateau is a milestone itself: That’s when you’ll know it’s time to release your second product.\nAfter we released product two, sales started to climb quickly, much faster than they did with the first product because we already had a built-in audience of customers willing to try our second product. In fact, our second product started out-selling product one within just a few weeks.\nThen something weird happened. Once the second product hit twenty-five sales a day, the first one jumped up from its plateau and began doing fifty sales a day! Sales that were previously flat had now doubled! The second product actually bumped up the first product.\nPreviously, we had feared that the two products might take sales away from one another, but they were actually feeding one another! Why did this happen? There were a couple factors at play. First, we had repeat customers\n\"\"\"","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-07-18T13:25:20.373129Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-07-18T13:25:20.373460Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-07-18T13:25:20.435907Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-07-18T13:25:20.373432Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-07-18T13:25:20.434933Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":27,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"tokenizer

No Such Thing as a Perfect Launch\nI’ve tried to find an example of someone who smashed their launch right out of the gate, doing everything perfectly\n But outside of major brands with millions of dollars in funding, literally zero examples come to mind\n\nThat’s probably because the purpose of the launch isn’t to put you on the map everywhere but just to get the wheels turning\n The hundreds of people who have used my work to become seven-figure business owners have almost always started from scratch, crawled their way to the starting line, launched with moderate success, and grown from there\n The launch gave them the momentum they needed to start growing\n\nI have a student named Anthony\n His first product was a baby carrier\n He went from being dead broke, working three jobs at once, having no time for his kids, to launching his first product\n Within eighteen months, he was a full- time entrepreneur\n\nWhen I tell you that, the assumption I just created is that he had such a good launch that it skyrocketed him to seven figures\n That’s not quite how it happens\n I often find that people have a misconception, believing that if they get the launch right, they’ll automatically be everywhere\n This idea of “one, two, skip a few, launch, you’re a millionaire” isn’t how it happens\n The launch is still in the beginning of the process, and now you have to have sales and momentum to be able to grow something\n\nRemember, you’re still in “The Grind\n”\nAnthony had a fine launch, but his biggest strength was that he was methodical about the process\n He had three to five products in mind\n He\nstacked the deck\n He launched one product, stoked the fire, and carefully repeated the process the same way for products two, three, four, and five\n\nYou can’t skip steps and put all your eggs in the launch basket\n Success comes from executing upon every little step along the way, not just the flashiest one\n\nThe Trillion-Dollar Marketplace\nYou may launch on Kickstarter or use Shopify to fulfill some of your orders, but most entrepreneurs find the best opportunities on Amazon\ncom\n Amazon is the biggest marketplace in the world, and the company is valued at a trillion dollars\n It’s important to understand that the process in this book is the same no matter what platform you’re on, but for a beginner there’s really nothing easier or more straightforward than selling on Amazon\n\nAs your brand builds momentum after your launch, Amazon will reward you with social proof and free customers\n Once you prove that you can bring customers to Amazon, it becomes its own marketing machine, putting you in front of millions of potential buyers\n You will start to rank for keywords\n You might start to appear on some of their advertising pages for free\n You might get a “new release,” “hot new release,” or “bestseller” badge, which will drive up conversions\n Lastly, you will start to get reviews, which can make (or break) your brand\n\nOne of my students, Nathan, recently surpassed sixty units a day within the first three months of his launch\n How? Just by following this process\n Why? Because the Amazon marketing machine saw the strength of his activities and turned on in his favor\n\nYou’ve probably seen the section on Amazon labeled “frequently bought together\n” As your friends and other people buy your product, Amazon starts looking at what they’ve bought before\n When this marketing machine kicks in, it shows your product on the listings of other similar products\n That’s free advertising\n\nThere are a few tricks that you can use to show up more often on Amazon —we’ll cover a few of them in the next chapter—but one mistake people make is allowing Amazon to determine the direction of their business\n You have it backward if you’re deciding what products to release based on what\n\nyou think will sell well on Amazon\n Build a business for your customers, and let the ease and scale of Amazon handle everything else\n\nThe biggest opportunity of selling on Amazon is that the platform rewards momentum\n The more momentum you can build, the more that momentum will accelerate\n How do you build that momentum? Loving on your audience\n Getting reviews\n Engaging your customers\n\nDon’t discount the supreme importance of speaking directly to the people buying your product\n Some people think they can stack the deck with fake reviews on Amazon, bought through review farms\n This ploy misses the point\n You’re not just trying to get sales; you’re trying to build a brand\n If you’re only focused on manipulating the algorithm, then you’re not focused on what matters: your customers\n\nThis is why I cringe when people say they have an “Amazon business\n” You don’t have an Amazon business\n You have a business that takes sales on Amazon\ncom\n\nIt’s easy to compare yourself to other similar businesses that also live on Amazon\n As a result, you will be tempted to make your pricing decisions and even your next product releases based on what your direct competitors are doing\n One of the most difficult things for a first-time business owner to understand is that competitors don’t matter nearly as much as you think\n\nHave you ever seen the picture of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps seconds before he defeats Chad le Clos to win yet another gold medal? Next to him, le Clos is looking at Phelps, watching him beat him by less than half a second\n The meme reads, “Winners focus on winning\n Losers focus on winners\n”\nIn business, you win by going all in on your customers\n If you focus on trying to “beat the winner,” the best you can hope for is getting caught up in a price war, which is a race to the bottom\n Play your game, let competitors play theirs, and trust the system will take care of itself\n\nIn fact, if you’re correctly executing this process, you won’t even be thinking about the competition\n You’ll be too busy talking directly to your customers, making sure you have a damn good product, and making sure they have a damn good experience\n\n\nDon’t Forget to Reorder\nIn this stage, you’re laser focused on sales, reviews, and making your customers happy\n\nWhat happens when you start making all those sales? You use up inventory\n And what happens as you go through inventory? If you’re not careful, you go out of business\n\nSometimes people are so excited about getting those first sales that they completely forget about reordering\n Without product to sell, you’re not running a business\n You can’t take sales, and you’re not making any revenue\n\nYou should consider reordering much earlier than you think and much sooner than you’re going to feel comfortable\n You may think, I have 500 units, and I’m making five sales a day\n That means I have 100 days to figure this out\n\nThe problem is that the minute a few positive reviews come in and sales jump to ten a day you’ll only have fifty days of inventory left\n If you keep doing your job, you’re going to end up with only ten days of inventory left\n That number will keep shrinking until it gets to zero\n\nThat’s why you want to order as much inventory as you can stomach at the beginning and order inventory again as soon as you’re able\n My strategy is to reorder as early as possible, as quickly as possible\n A rule of thumb: As soon as you prove your product has life, order the next round of inventory\n As soon as your launch is complete or you pass ten sales per day, start queuing up the next order\n\nI know that running out of stock is the worst thing that can happen because, as you read earlier, it happened to me\n I’d like to say it only happened to me once, but it’s happened in multiple businesses\n It sneaks up on you\n\nIt was like starting over again each time we ran out of stock\n We had to rebuild buzz, and we also lost all the momentum we’d built\n I’ve had products that ran out of inventory but got their momentum back in a couple days\n I’ve also had products that ran out of stock and never regained that momentum\n It’s just not a risk you want to take, so have a plan to ensure that you never run out of stock\n\nIf you do happen to blow through your inventory, it’s okay to put people on a waiting list; you just have to perform the process again, and you have to\n\ncommunicate with your customers\n\nI once bought a protein cereal that I found on Instagram\n After I’d ordered\n—and paid—they sent me an email saying it was back-ordered and would be delayed\n\nThat’s not cool\n\nIf your inventory is on back order, tell your customers right on the sales page\n This information may actually increase sales\n Showing you have demand creates social proof, and it may even justify a price hike\n If your customers are cool with waiting, you’ll get the sale\n If they don’t want to wait, they’re still likely to pay attention when your inventory is in stock again\n The key is to let them make their own informed choice, so your brand isn’t tainted with the feeling of a bait-and-switch\n\nGo All In on Your Customers\nIt’s exciting to see sales coming in for the first time, and it’s fun to start calculating the amount of money that you might make if you can sustain the growth\n However, since you’re in the people business now, you must avoid the critical mistake of thinking it’s all about you\n\nYes, you created a cool product, and you worked hard for this, but now your product is in the hands of other people\n Those early customers can become raving fans that give you reviews and tell their friends about you, or they can be the reason why your business stalls out\n Once you’ve got sales for your product, your job becomes treating those customers like gold, knowing that some of them are going to leave reviews\n\nThis is the point where I always get a million questions: How do I get reviews? When do I get them? How many reviews do I need?\nHow many reviews do you need? Zero\n Plenty of people made a ton of money before the days of reviews\n How many do you want? Simple: as many as you can get\n\nThere are multimillion-dollar products out there with thousands of reviews, but there are also multimillion-dollar products with only 100 reviews\n Yes, more is technically better, but my philosophy on reviews is that they should confirm a purchase, not be the reason for it\n Many Amazon sellers fall into the trap of getting more reviews than “the next guy,” rather\n\nthan focusing on creating great products and treating customers well\n Reviews are important, but they are far less important than the rest of the formula for getting to $1 million: three to five products, twenty-five sales a day, at an average price point of $30\n With those numbers, you don’t need hundreds of reviews; you need just enough to get past people’s bullshit detectors\n\nContinually contributing to the pre-launch community you built is the best way to get buy-in that leads to reviews\n Continue to document the growth of your business and the impact your business is making\n Continue to bring in the photos that other people post of your product on social media\n Take those and highlight them to the rest of your community\n By doing this you continue to build up your community\n\nCelebrate the reviews you do get\n Take screenshots and post them on social media\n Send unsolicited gifts to people who leave reviews\n Reach out personally to people who talk about your business on social media\n Those relationships will create millions of dollars over the long run—go all in on them\n\nThat type of commitment and attention to your customers will foster a community that supports you, loves to leave reviews for your product, and eagerly chooses you over the competition\n\nThen, once in a while, you can go for the ask: “Hey, we’ve just launched this new product, and we’ve been selling for fourteen days now\n We might even run out of stock at this point! But we really need more reviews, to spread the word, to keep pushing this message, and to get more people into yoga [or CrossFit or sunglasses or eating pineapple—whatever your group is into]\n If you have used the product, and you love it, please consider leaving us a review on Amazon [or on Shopify, or Walmart\ncom, or wherever you’re taking orders]\n”\nAmazon’s search results are highly driven by conversion rate, not reviews\n Reviews impact conversion rate, but conversion rate is what matters\n Here’s the beauty of this: In theory, if you have more positive\n \nreviews than the next person, you’ll make more sales, have a higher conversion rate, and rank higher\n However, if you have an audience that chooses you over everyone else, your conversion rate is going to be higher even if you don’t have a ton of reviews\n Having a responsive audience drives up your conversion rates, which drives up your position on Amazon\n\nReaching a few dozen reviews during your first few months means you have enough reviews to get to twenty-five or thirty sales a day\n You might not have a million-dollar product, but you’ll have enough to get to twenty- five sales a day, which is your only goal before you repeat the entire process\n Remember, all you need is twenty-five sales a day\n Keep your focus tight, and when you get to the point where you’ve proven your product has enough action in the marketplace, roll out products two, three, and four\n Then you continue the journey to $1 million\n\nYou might find, however, that a product launch done well takes you straight to the million\n\nThat’s what happened to my friend Cathryn Lavery, co-founder of BestSelf Co\n, a company that helps people become more efficient, focused, and productive—in short, their best selves\n Cathryn wasn’t intending to start the business she did; it came about as an unintended result of scratching her own itch\n\n“At the time, my partner and I had our own businesses,” she said, “and we started an Amazon business on top of everything\n We didn’t care at all about that Amazon business—we were selling random stuff, salt and pepper shakers, nothing that mattered to us\n We were spread way too thinly\n We were just looking for a framework to help us get everything done\n We both wrote things down in Moleskine notebooks, and we liked to nerd out together on how we’d plan our days out\n Eventually we realized that we could design our own productivity framework into something much more beautiful and functional\n I designed it, Allen made a prototype, and we decided to launch\n”\n \nCathryn immediately wanted to launch on Kickstarter, but Allen disagreed\n “He wanted to do a product launch formula, but I wanted to do Kickstarter, so we compromised and did a product launch that turned into a Kickstarter\n\n“Crowdfunding is incredible because there’s a time limit\n People see something they want—your product, or the idea of your product—and they see a clock that tells them we need this much money by this countdown or you’re not getting this thing you want\n Kickstarter also has shoppers who just back products on the platform\n They have 15 million backers, and more than a third of those are repeat backers who come back and back and back to promote products\n”\nProduct development for Cathryn, like any other brand, was a long journey with a lot of changes\n “We listened carefully to what our customers were saying\n We gave journals away for free and took feedback on how it worked for users,” she said\n “When people get to be a part of development, they feel ownership over it, and they feel part of the success of the company\n”\nCathryn also stacked the deck with an email list she’d been compiling for three months, through content she’d been putting out on Medium\ncom\n When launch day on Kickstarter came, they had the incredible luck of getting tweeted by Arianna Huffington as a boost to their name recognition\n\nTheir Kickstarter for the BestSelf Co\n SELF journal was funded in a scorchingly fast twenty-two hours\n Part of the success was how they priced their funding levels to get Kickstarter’s platform boost\n “The Kickstarter algorithm prefers number of pledges over total amount pledged,” Cathryn said\n “So, for instance, if you have ten pledges of $500, and someone else has a thousand pledges of $5, you’ve raised the same amount of money, but the other company will have gotten far more attention\n We used this to our advantage\n We had a one-dollar reward level on our project, and it skyrocketed us onto the platform\n”\nEarly-bird rewards are also a huge hack to get more exposure\n “The secret to funding fast is to set up early-bird rewards that equal your funding goal\n People love getting rewarded for getting in first, and you get funded fast, look successful, and the algorithm loves you\n We set it up so we only needed 200 early backers to hit our whole goal\n We got it in two days\n It’s not that many people\n”\nKickstarter’s organic traffic is a huge boost, which is why Cathryn and\n\nAllen put so much focus on getting momentum on the platform\n One-third of all backers on their project were organic hits from people just browsing Kickstarter—eyeballs BestSelf Co\n didn’t have to do anything to get\n\nAfter the launch on Kickstarter, they put a “Preorder” button on the Kickstarter page, to which they were running no traffic, doing no extra work\n Cathryn looked at the analytics a few days later and realized that the sales were three times what they were doing on Amazon in an entire month\n\nShe called Allen and told him she couldn’t bring herself to go back to the Amazon business and that she wanted to focus on BestSelf Co\n He agreed\n\n“Great, we’ll shut that business down,” she said\n\n“Um, no,” he replied\n “We’ll sell it\n” (No need to burn the house down on the way out the door\n)\nThey went all in on BestSelf Co\n and their Kickstarter campaign\n Then Cathryn and BestSelf Co\n got noticed by Daymond John, of FUBU and Shark Tank\n BestSelf Co\n went from mid–six figures to a million-dollar business in seven months, and that scaling had nothing to with Kickstarter\n “We expanded our product range,” she said\n “We realized that the people who would buy their journal would buy other things to help them with productivity\n We remembered watching Shark Tank and thinking about some of the businesses we saw—that’s not a business, that’s a product\n We never wanted to be that, so we’ve been focused on diversifying ever since\n”\nCathryn’s story demonstrates that if you have a great product, you are good to your customers, and you stack the deck toward a great launch, you eventually hit pay dirt, even if it’s not in the way that you first imagined\n\nHalfway to a Million\nAt this point in the process, I like to tell entrepreneurs that they are halfway to their first million\n They never believe me\n Never\n So, allow me to take a moment to tell you how far you’ve already come: You are halfway to your first million\n\n“How could that be?” you ask\n “We just started taking sales for our product! I am not doing half a million dollars right now!”\nAt the moment, that may be true, but you’ll be shocked at how fast the snowball starts rolling at this point\n Your journey so far has been making\n\ndecisions, getting your product ready, and taking an order\n You’ve been in The Grind\n Now we enter The Growth period, where your sales start to compound\n While everyone is different, many entrepreneurs get to their first million just six months from this point\n\nThat means that you might be halfway to your first million after all\n\nA few months ago, you hadn’t even begun your journey\n Maybe you didn’t even know what you wanted to sell\n Now, you’ve launched, you’re taking sales, and you will soon be getting repeat customers and referrals, too\n\nYou can actually build a million-dollar business\n\nI’ve seen people pace $1 million after one or two products quite quickly\n They go live\n Then within three or four months they have 100 sales a day, which means they’ve crossed that $1 million threshold\n\nIt can happen that fast, but everybody starts at zero\n Everyone starts by doubting themselves\n Everybody wonders if it’s going to work\n If you stick with this process, stay devoted to your customers, and watch the power of compounding returns take hold, you can build a million-dollar business, as hundreds of my students have\n You might even build a billion-dollar business\n\nBut wait, forget a billion dollars—how do you get those twenty-five sales, every single day? Keep reading to find out\n\n Entrepreneur Spotlight: Kevin Pasco and Jeremy Sherk\nKevin Pasco and Jeremy Sherk co-founded Vancouver-based Nested Naturals in late 2013\n The company launched in the summer of 2014 with two products: Luna, a natural sleep aid, and a Canadian maple syrup\n\nAt first, Kevin and Jeremy planned to sell health foods as well as supplements—but building a brand around both maple syrup and sleep aids was proving difficult\n After looking at the sales numbers, they quickly decided to focus solely on supplements\n\nThey bootstrapped the company with loans from family\n From his\n\n mother, Jeremy got an initial $10,000 loan that went into upfront costs —mainly purchasing inventory, but also for label design and building the company website\n Once they began to grow, Kevin’s mother loaned the company another ten grand\n\nKevin and Jeremy were focused on one guiding mission for their products: quality ingredients\n They wanted honest, transparent products that were natural, organic, and non-GMO\n No artificial ingredients, ever\n This would become the core of their branding—even if they had no idea at the time\n\nThe first sale of their Luna sleep aid happened the first day it was put up on Amazon\n Kevin and Jeremy’s reaction to a single sale? They were ecstatic\n\n“Holy shit! Someone actually bought the thing that we just worked seven months on! That’s what we kept saying,” Kevin told me\n “Even though we’d obviously been working toward that goal, to have it actually work seemed crazy to us\n”\nThe climb to greater sales was slow at first because the product didn’t have a built-in audience and no advertising was put into promoting it\n The partners just threw Luna up on Amazon and their website, taking it one day at a time\n\nThey had a lot of help in the beginning\n Jeremy joined my small mastermind group, which helped remove the unknown\n It added to the good foundation of knowledge Jeremy had from being well versed in internet marketing, online business, and marketing in general\n He went into Nested Naturals prepared to do the work, to do whatever it took to make it successful\n And with that mindset, success came more quickly than he planned\n\nIt was that ethos and mindset—and staying true to their values— that helped make Nested Naturals what it is today, generating fans and customers who supported the brand\n\nAs they grew, Kevin and Jeremy experimented with different ways of building a social audience: They offered coupons, put a URL on their product bottles, and did anything they could to drive customers back to their website\n When they got customer information or got them on their email list, they personally followed up\n\nOne of their biggest early problems was running out of stock,\n\n which happened half a dozen times\n The partners were only able to order as much product as they could pay for at the time, which led to overselling—all part of the growing pains of a bootstrapped business\n Negotiating terms with suppliers was tough, and it was even tougher when inventory that was supposed to last two months sold out in half that time\n\nDespite these growing pains, things got better and moved faster as the company continued to iterate through repeated sales cycles\n Eventually, it had enough cash reserves to order as much inventory as needed\n “Three months in, we had a lot more sales than we’d anticipated,” Kevin told me\n “We were getting probably one or two dozen orders a day\n”\nThe company generated a million dollars in revenue the first year, mostly from sales of Luna\n By the ninth or tenth month, sales had reached a couple thousand dollars a day\n\nKevin and Jeremy found themselves in an odd, relatively rare position: They’d always wanted to have a brand with multiple products, but Luna did so well they couldn’t keep up with its growth at first, much less launch other products\n\n“We realized we had to completely shift our mindset to get the company on track,” Jeremy said\n\nThe partners had originally intended to split net profits in half\n They realized their business would never grow if they didn’t reinvest what they made, especially since they didn’t want to take on outside investment\n So they buckled in for a lean journey\n They each took $2,000 a month out for the first year—just enough to barely survive\n They put everything else they had into launching more products and making them work, even if it meant a year of living like monks\n\nThe company’s second product was Super Greens, a greens powder used to make nutritional drinks\n They put a lot of focus on label design to establish the Nested Naturals brand and turn it into a company offering a variety of natural supplements\n The approach, which was probably more labor-intensive than absolutely necessary, was for each product to have its unique branding, label, and colors\n Each product was like its own brand, with a different look and feel, essentially\n Doing different designs for different products got people’s\n\n attention\n\nDown the road, however, this became a problem\n People thought\neach product was from a different company\n Even people who knew the partners thought Nested Naturals had started selling for other companies\n A switch to a unified brand had to be made\n\nKevin was afraid there would be customer pushback on the change, but there wasn’t a single complaint\n “The lesson we learned there is that no one micro-analyzes and overthinks branding more than a company’s owners,” Kevin said\n “Branding is important, but your customers aren’t going to sweat it as much as you do\n”\nIt wasn’t until the company was doing $2\n5 to $3 million a year that the partners decided to build out an office and hire employees\n They wanted to do what they needed to do to grow bigger and faster\n Traditional retail supplement brands generally have up to 500 products, and they were still only selling ten\n\nA former-competitor-turned-friend, who was also the first person the partners met in my mastermind group, gave the partners some great advice: “You can’t do it alone\n”\nKevin and Jeremy started hiring\n They discussed but decided against a remote team, opting to set up office space\n “Having everyone in one place makes for better communication and culture, as well as greater employee investment in the company,” Jeremy said\n “It was the right move, but the costs were huge\n”\nThey tried to keep exorbitant Vancouver rents at bay by setting up their office in a hundred-year-old building, rather than in one that had just been built\n\nNevertheless, the company plateaued during the first year after opening its office doors\n Sales didn’t increase at all\n Kevin attributed this to a loss of focus\n “We were all over the map that year,” he said\n “Should we go into retail? Wholesale? Sell on Facebook? We needed to get back to basics\n”\nOnce they refocused on their core competency, selling natural supplements on Amazon, the company started growing again\n Now, three years later, they have grown to four times the size, pulling in a million dollars in revenue each month, with a staff of fifteen, in addition to several contractors who work remotely\n\n\n According to Kevin, there are things you can and should do when starting out that can’t be done once you get bigger\n You can test things out, change your branding, and even change your name\n “Focus on getting things right when you start out so that you can then scale smoothly, as opposed to growing as quickly as possible as early as possible,” he said\n\nIt’s equally important to make sure you have someone to handle inventory by the time you expand your line from one item to ten\n This could be a part-time contractor at first, as long as they have the right experience\n And, when starting out, don’t just chase after revenue\n A lot of things can start to break and go wrong once you begin selling more\n When you’re properly set up to scale, you can focus much more exclusively on selling more and more product\n\nIt’s important, too, to be careful once you start to succeed\n “You start looking at ways you can spend money to grow the business,” Jeremy said\n “That’s when you’re going to make mistakes if you’re not careful\n”\nOnce you can afford it, you start feeling there’s a lot of help out there to take advantage of, but that’s not always the case\n “We went down the wrong road with influencers in particular, thinking, OK, let’s throw ten grand at influencers and see what happens\n Of course, it’s going to work,” Jeremy said\n “It was probably the biggest mistake we ever made\n We got maybe $100 total back in sales\n”\nWhat Kevin and Jeremy have discovered is that the best way to grow their business is to stay as lean as possible\n With rare exceptions, they’ve resisted trying to buy their way to growth\n They’ve focused on earning their growth by being as strategic as possible and really thinking issues through\n\nKevin and Jeremy are still 50/50 partners and are as excited as ever to be running the company\n They believe there’s a lot of growth to be had\n Each quarter is a fresh quarter, bringing new, exciting initiatives\n They have an amazing team in Vancouver that oversees the nuts and bolts of the business, so they’re less hands-on than before, but they’re still fired up for the business\n With more personnel, things move a bit more slowly, but the business is still nimble and adaptable\n Even today, things change at a rapid pace\n\n\n Jeremy is just excited to be a part of it\n “In the years I’ve been running my brand, a lot of my peers have started and sold companies, maybe even multiple times,” he said\n “But Kevin and I were never looking for a quick buck or a quick exit\n”\nThey believe they can reach new levels with this business, which will ultimately create a bigger exit down the line—though they don’t have a timeline for that\n As long as their hearts are still in it and they believe there’s more success on the horizon, they’re still 100 percent invested\n In fact, instead of looking to be acquired, they’re interested in investing and acquiring other companies\n There are many different pathways in the entrepreneurial game\n The key is to get going, according to Jeremy and Kevin\n\n“Winners start and move toward something,” Kevin said\n “Losers are paralyzed by inaction\n”\n\n8\nStep Six: Growing to Twenty-Five Sales a Day\nIn the wake of the 2008 economic crash, women and men in their twenties watched the corporate life they’d been sold come crashing down\n As a result, aspiring entrepreneurs across the globe sat unfulfilled, chained to desks\n The economy was flat, and the “old way” to success had collapsed, which stirred entrepreneurial desires among millions of young people itching to go out on their own\n\nOne of those twenty-somethings was Aubrey Marcus\n Like most hustlers, he tried his hand at a few entrepreneurial ventures, and he threw things at the wall to see what would stick\n His first attempts: sex toys and hangover supplements\n\nNeither gave him success or internal fulfillment\n\n“I wasn’t ready,” he said, looking back\n\nAlthough his attempts didn’t lead him to the freedom he sought, they did\nshow him how to create a product, how to sell, and how to advertise\n The process also helped him network with others who could help him along the way\n That’s what led him to a lunch meeting with Joe Rogan\n\nIn the early days of Joe’s podcast (now downloaded more than 200 million times per month), Aubrey advertised his sex toys on the show, becoming one of Joe’s biggest sponsors\n\n  \n“I asked Joe what he was into,” Aubrey recalled\n “And he said, ‘I’m really into nootropics right now\n’ I told him that I would create the best in the world\n”\nWhat he didn’t tell Joe was that he had no idea what a nootropic was\n But he promised Joe that he would develop the best one in the world\n\nAubrey was soon down the product-research rabbit hole, reading studies and testing ingredients, until he ultimately formulated the brain supplement Alpha Brain\n\nHe gave some of the newly released Alpha Brain to Joe, who loved it so much that he agreed to partner with Aubrey on the new project, named Onnit\n As a new owner, he also agreed to talk about it on the podcast\n As a result, Joe brought Alpha Brain to his millions of subscribers on a weekly basis\n The product quickly sold out, and Aubrey had to scramble to order more inventory\n\nAubrey is a perfect example that success often follows major failures\n Failure has a way of opening new doors that you didn’t see before\n Even if your first attempt doesn’t go the way you want, it can pave the way for your big breakthrough\n\nOnce the product was back in stock, Joe talked about it on the podcast, and it sold out again\n This cycle continued until the company raised a small amount of money to keep up with the growth\n\nThere was no vision for an empire; it was pure entrepreneurial drive\n “I was just desperate to make something happen,” Aubrey said\n\nBefore long, Alpha Brain was the best-selling brain-enhancing supplement ever\n It created a category all on its own—natural nootropics\n The company, however, was based on the success of just one product\n The company was growing, and the profit margins were high, but Aubrey knew he needed to release more products if he wanted to be a real brand\n\n  \n“It wasn’t until then,” Aubrey explained, “that I had a vision for what I was doing and why I was doing it\n”\nOnnit soon released New Mood, a serotonin booster made to calm down the brain and help to manage stress, and Shroom Tech, a blend of earth- grown mushrooms\n\nThen the company started selling kettlebells\n And battle ropes\n And medicine balls\n Then food, protein powder, and nut butters\n\nThe company went hard into podcast advertising, and it worked well for them\n They gained national exposure, and it wasn’t long before their t-shirts were seen in gyms all over the country\n Then they opened a gym\n\nInstead of settling as a brain-optimization company, Aubrey sprinted full- throttle into becoming a total human optimization company\n That included brain, body, and mind\n Today, the Onnit headquarters in Austin, Texas, is buzzing with jujitsu classes, a full cafe, and more than 100 employees\n They continue to be mentioned on the Joe Rogan Experience and many other podcasts, and they have a raving fan base around the globe\n\nThink about a series of products that serve the same person: That’s the power of a brand\n\nWelcome to The Growth\nFew people understand how powerful it is to take an idea from scratch, bring it to life, and make a sale\n This is why I say entrepreneurs are the most powerful people on the planet; we literally make things up, make them real, and sell them to other people\n\nProving you can take an order for a new product validates your idea\n It proves it’s real\n Then it becomes your job to turn that into a machine that now creates predictable sales\n\nYour entire focus in this stage of the process is to create a stream of sales that regularly churns out at least twenty-five sales per day of your product\n You do that by continuing the momentum you created by going all in on your customer: getting excellent reviews, responding to every comment, thanking your customers, connecting with influencers, and continually stoking the fire on a one-to-one basis\n Doing all this will get you the reviews, exposure, publicity, and word-of-mouth advertising you need to hit the twenty-five-\n\nsales-per-day mark\n\nWhen you have a consistent twenty-five sales per day, you have a\nmachine that can be applied to more products\n At that point, you will release multiple products into the machine, and your business will surge past 100 sales per day, giving you the million\n Yes, it can happen that quickly\n\nBut first, we need to build that machine through The Growth\n To get there, we need a process to turn a few customers into many\n\nHow Big Can You Go?\nWhen Matt and I first started selling our Sheer Strength products, one of my coaches asked me, “How big do you want the business to go?”\nI’ll be honest; the first thing that popped into my head was: What kind of a question is that? Huge, obviously\n Astronomical\n World-obliteratingly massive\n\nBut I came up with a concrete answer\n “A hundred sales a day,” I said\n “That would be a million-dollar business\n”\n“What are you at now?” he asked\n\n“Five sales a day\n”\nThis was way back before Amazon was the behemoth it is today\n This\nwas also before automation tools and “influencers” were a thing; we did most of our marketing by hand\n We called our customers\n We talked to our friends, asked them what they thought, and begged for a review if they liked it\n We did whatever we could to get reviews, and we celebrated every time a new one came in\n\nA hundred sales a day sounded like a pipe dream to me at the time\n\nNo one comes out of the gate with a consistent stream of sales; it has to be built\n\nIt’s not uncommon to start with twenty to twenty-five sales a day during launch, only to see them come to a screeching halt once you squeeze every drop of juice out of your launch lemon\n To keep that initial momentum going, you need reviews, testimonials, and good old-fashioned advertising; you’re going to have to stoke the fire again and again for the next few months—and then strategically launch your follow-up products\n\nGetting to twenty-five sales a day is not super difficult; the prep to get\n\nthere is\n The good news is you’ll have completed most of that by this point\n From here, every inch forward creates a compounding return because you begin to experience repeat customers, you have a list and a process, and the whole operation starts to become a machine\n Without this prep, however, you can get stuck on how far you are from the magic number and lose hope\n\nThere’s no algorithm for going from five to twenty-five sales a day\n It’s about building relationships with people, building trust with your customers, and building awareness in the marketplace\n That’s a brand\n\nWhen Matt and I were doing our own customer support with Sheer Strength, grinding it out and doing whatever we needed to do to get a review, we were totally lost\n Calling customers is putting oneself out there in a big way, and it was scary\n But that’s also part of being an entrepreneur\n We were just willing to outwork everyone who tried to get in the game at the same time as us\n\nOne of my employees once reflected on those early times\n She said about me, “When I started working with him, I thought he was this entrepreneur who had all the answers to everything\n Then, about a year ago, I realized that Ryan has no idea what he’s doing\n”\nOkay, that’s a little harsh\n\nIt’s also basically true\n\nWe are all winging it in life, and in business, to some extent\n\nWe all think everybody else has it all figured out—and, believe me, no\none does\n At best, we’re all competent at a few things and guessing our way through everything else\n\nYou don’t know what’s going to happen when you release a product to the marketplace\n You don’t know what’s going to happen when you call a customer\n You do know that, at some point, you’re going to get hateful comments on Facebook, and you’re just going to have to get over it\n You can ignore it, or you can play with it\n Consider having fun with it; after all, it’s a sign of success\n\nYou will get a negative review, and it will hurt\n It will make you want to quit\n It will also hurt your sales\n It’s all part of the process\n Look at it as data gathering\n If you’re too afraid of a few haters to build up a Facebook group, you’re really going to suffer when it comes to growing the business past five or ten sales a day\n\nWhen I was in college, I planned on becoming a pastor\n My professors in\n\ncollege prepared me to be ready for criticism\n Sure, they meant while we were talking from the pulpit, but products aren’t that different\n Not everyone is going to like you or what you put out into the world\n Someone will always be upset over something you said\n It just comes with the territory\n\nThat’s not to say that every call I made to a customer ended in angry tirades or tears\n Occasionally they’d be pissed, but nine times out of ten, people were blown away\n Even the people who angrily asked, “Why are you calling me?” were taken aback a bit when I responded with, “I’m the founder of the company, and I just want to ensure you had a five-star experience\n”\nThat little touch—showing that I was already on the phone, genuinely interested in hearing about their experience—was enough to tip the scales\n\nAddicted to Feedback\nThere may be no formula or magic potion that guarantees sales growth, but I have found certain milestones do lead to a bump in sales\n For example, you will see a major bump when you cross twenty-five positive reviews\n And you’ll see a bigger bump when you cross the 100-review mark because that means you’re the real thing\n There is something about seeing 100 people approve your product that crosses the bullshit detector in people’s brains\n\nThose first twenty-five to fifty reviews can be enough to get you over the twenty-five-sales-a-day mark\n A hundred will almost certainly do it; every market is a little bit different, but that’s when you have enough in the marketplace to be legit, which often leads to a big spike in sales\n\nAgain, everybody wants a formula for how long it takes to get more sales and to hit those milestones, but it’s just not predictable\n You just have to do the work\n The first time I launched a product, it took me about three months to get to twenty-five sales a day\n Now I can do it in about fourteen to thirty days because my customer list is bigger, I have thousands of repeat customers, and my process is more dialed in\n You’ll get there, too\n\nWhen a customer purchases your product, you can follow up with him or her in one of two ways\n One option is to reach out and say, “Hey, I hope you liked the product\n Could you please leave us a review?”\nPass\n She has better things to do, dude\n\nThe second option is to say, “Hi, Natalie\n Did your order arrive on time? I\n\njust wanted to make sure it got there when it was supposed to\n”\nThat’s a give\n That’s a deposit into the relationship bank account\n\nWhen Natalie replies that it did, you follow up again: “Great, thanks so\nmuch for the feedback\n I just credited $10 to your account as a thank-you for letting me know\n Is there anything else we should know about the brand? What would you like to see us release next?”\nNatalie is thinking, Damn, this company is AMAZING\n\nNow you’re in an exchange\n You’re building a relationship\n You’re giving the customer something they love—value, and the thrill of feeling special—but getting so much more in return\n Always go for the give\n\nFrom there, if your customer gives you feedback or a great idea, keep going: “Hey, that’s great to hear\n Thanks so much for the kind words\n If you feel like sharing about your experience, we would love your feedback in the form of an Amazon review\n” That’ll do it, every time\n\nWhen a customer does leave you feedback, screenshot it and post about it on Instagram\n Publicly celebrate it\n Show the community that you are listening\n Your job at this point is to make your customers addicted to giving you feedback\n They don’t just like your product; they love giving you reviews\n They love supporting a company that’s so involved in their community\n\nWhat If I’m Stuck at Ten Sales per Day?\nYou’re going to get stuck at times\n\nSome get stuck around ten sales per day\n They launch, get to twenty-five\nsales a day, then have pullback\n They start thinking, I don’t know what to do now\n They start worrying about numbers and algorithms and stop being curious about the process and the people behind the purchase\n They don’t open up customer loops\n They don’t think, Who are my people, and where are they hanging out? Instead, they figure, Well, my product must not be good enough; guess I better go find another product to launch\n\nThey spend all that time stacking the deck, building up an audience for a launch, and then they just walk away because it’s not an instant success\n Or, even worse, they think, I don’t understand\n My product is better than everybody else’s\n It deserves more sales\n Why aren’t people buying it in\n\ndroves?\nJust because you think your product is better than anything else on the\nmarket doesn’t mean it will outsell everyone else\n That’s not how it works\n Any idiot (and I’m not calling you the idiot!) can throw a product up for sale on a place like Amazon and start to get ten sales a day\n And that idiot can buy reviews from cheap Chinese accounts until he or she gets caught and banned (yes, I know many people who have done this)\n It takes the willingness to keep grinding, being in the weeds, and cultivating a following to grow to twenty-five sales per day and beyond\n\nIf you plateau, your temptation is going to be to think bigger\n I recommend you do the opposite—go super micro\n Remember my advice to Ken? What can you do this week to get ten more reviews? What can you do this week to blow a customer away? What can you do this week to motivate your following? Who can you contact this week who might talk about you publicly?\nI have students who get a bump in sales every time they talk about their product on their own personal Facebook page because they’re communicating with a different set of people\n They highlight a different feature about the product, or they simply hit people at the right time\n Sometimes, doing the small things for long enough is all it takes\n\nThere are a few things that you can “turn up” to increase sales, though\n\n1\n Use Amazon’s pay-per-click platform\n Amazon allows you to advertise within its own search results, which is extremely effective and expensive\n You may have to spend more money acquiring the customer than you reap in profit, which means you’ll be operating at a loss\n However, you’ll build your review machine, acquire new customers, and continue feeding the algorithm\n In this case, it’s better to take sales at zero profit than to take no sales at all\n\n2\n Run video ads on Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube\n If you decide to go this route, I recommend starting with customer testimonials as your first test\n You can never sell your product better than other customers can\n It’s fast to test different messages and ads, so test several approaches until one of them clicks\n\n\n3\n Put attention back into building your community\n Turn your attention away from sales and instead put it into your community\n Go back to the customer and what they want\n Go back to stacking the deck\n You can do a “re-launch” if you feel called to\n The important thing is to return to interacting with your potential customers\n\nI have a student—name withheld for reasons that are about to become obvious—who is in the pet supplies business\n He launched his first product and initially did well, but then he got stuck\n\nHe’s not his own target demographic, so he doesn’t already know the answers to what his customers want\n That’s okay\n You can get past that as long as you’re willing to listen closely to your customers\n But he stopped caring about the people behind his product, which was his brand’s death sentence\n\nHe came to me and said, “I’m stuck\n How do I break out of this?”\n“What are you doing now?” I asked\n\n“I’m focusing on reviews, I have a really good product, and I’m\nlaunching more products\n”\n“Okay,” I said\n “Where do your customers hang out so that we can\nadvertise to them?”\n“No idea,” he said\n\n“Well, you might want to start by figuring that out\n”\nHe didn’t know, and he didn’t care that he didn’t know\n He just wanted to\nsell more stuff\n\nThose people should be your sole focus as you sprint toward twenty-five\nsales and build your review machine\n You want to know who those people are, where you can find them, how you can create the best products for them\n Then, if they love your products and brand and the experience you’ve created, maybe they will leave you a review\n\nBut, Ryan, What If I’ve Tried Everything and My Brand Still Doesn’t Gain Traction?\nAt this point, some of you are going to be saying, “But I’ve done all of that— I’ve done all of the things, and I’ve done them well—and it’s still failed to\n\ngain traction\n Why, Ryan, why?”\nHonestly, I can’t tell you why—but your customers can\n\nIf you ask them, they will tell you\n Reach out to your most active\nfollowers and customers and ask for feedback\n\n“Do you want this? Would you buy this? Why or why not?” And then\nyou need to listen\n\nI’m working with a company right now, and I happen to be their target\nmarket, so they sent me their product: a low-calorie fruit powder\n It tasted good, looked good, and should have been a good product\n But, as a customer, I had a big problem: I didn’t understand how to use their product\n It’s not that I couldn’t figure out the powder\n I just had no idea when I would prefer to use this powder instead of regular, plain old fruit\n (“Stir it in yogurt!” Fruit\n “Add it to smoothies!” Frozen fruit\n “Just add water!” Um, why?)\nI gave this feedback to my contact at the company, and, instead of listening, he told me why I was wrong\n He gave me a rational, intellectual breakdown of why I—the customer—just didn’t understand the product\n\n“Dude,” he said emphatically, as though if he just said it another way I would finally grasp the concept\n “It replaces fruit!”\nI still can’t figure out why I’d want that\n\nSomeday, he’ll get it\n He’ll have a great launch because he’s got a big audience\n The product will sell\n People will be excited to try it, and then it’s going to head to the back of their cupboard, where they’ll never touch it again\n\nIf your product fails to gain traction, despite your steps to do everything right, then it’s likely that something went wrong in the initial stages\n Entrepreneurs are big thinkers, but they often think too big at this stage in the process\n Go back to the customer, to the following\n Focus on the micro\n\nMaybe you didn’t get enough people in one spot\n We’ve talked about needing to create a place that has at least 1,000 followers talking about the product\n Maybe you tried one thing on Instagram, and something else on Reddit, and then a third thing on your YouTube channel\n Now you have a lot going on, and it may seem like everyone is talking about your product, but you still don’t have 1,000 people in one place\n\nI have a student named Michael who sells products for gardeners\n During the stack-the-deck phase, Michael went all in on a Facebook group; he doesn’t have an Instagram following, and he’s not on any other platform\n He\n\njust focused on building that Facebook group and now has 14,000 gardeners all in one place\n He can launch whatever he wants and get all the feedback he needs\n As a result, he can also earn whatever profit he wants\n\nWhat did he do to get those 14,000 leads? He created a community that was responsive and helpful, and people invited their friends\n Now the group grows by hundreds of people each week without him lifting a finger\n He promotes his product in cool and ethical ways within the group, and his community rewards him for it\n\nI’m Making Twenty-Five Sales a Day! What Do I Do Now?\nFirst of all: Congratulations! You’ve built a machine that can support a million-dollar business\n\nNow what?\nEasy: It’s time to repeat the process\n Get ready for launch number two, and then three, and then four, and then five\n\nIn fact, you never stop repeating the process\n You go back to where all your customers showed up, and you engage even more\n\nPeople often ask me, “If I do everything right, what percentage of my first-launch customers should I expect to come back and be repeat customers?”\nIf you did everything right, this answer is easy, too: all of them\n\nAll those people who love your first product and who had a great experience with you and your company will come back and buy product number two\n If you do this right—if you create those leads, if you talk to them and listen to them, and do all the people-oriented things we’ve talked about so far—you can expect return buyers\n\nThe process for launch two is just warming up all of those previous customers so that you have an even bigger launch the second time around\n In fact, it should be even easier now as there’s no ramp-up process for product number two\n While you worked hard and put all your time into launching the first product, product two will come more easily\n You’re simply engaging more with what the customers who have already purchased from you want\n\n\nSo, you can skip the stacking-the-deck process and double down on the people who are already there\n\nYou’re in the home stretch, really\n Now we sprint to the million\n\nDo you remember Travis and Jenna Zigler, the optometrists I talked about earlier? Their brand is called Eyelove, and they did a fantastic job of paying attention to their customers\n They do Q&As with their customers and actually listen to the questions and feedback they get\n They regularly do Facebook Live events to interact with all their raving fans as well\n\nTheir products have higher price points, but every time they launch a new product, they go from zero to fifty sales a day within a few weeks\n People leave reviews, and it snowballs\n That focus gave them the machine that has now built a multimillion-dollar business\n\nWhen you finally hit that magic number of twenty-five sales a day, it’s time for you to start building your snowball, too\n It’s time to choose product two\n Let’s look at how exactly to do that\n\n Entrepreneur Spotlight: Jason Franciosa\nJason Franciosa was coming off a failed business and searching online for what to do next when one of my ads popped up on his screen\n Immediately intrigued, he decided to join my community at Capitalism\ncom\n\nAfter learning my method, Jason dove right in and launched his company, Element 26\n\nJason and his business partner, who is a doctor in physical therapy, looked at a bunch of ideas for products\n In the end, they came to exactly where Matt and I had ended up with Sheer Strength: They targeted themselves as the customer\n\nThey were both avid weightlifters\n The fastener on their weight belts always failed over time\n\n“It was pretty obvious what product to put out first,” Jason told me\n\nThey knew that the true key to success with this product would be\n\n doing something different\n They weren’t alone in their struggles with Velcro\n When they looked at all the biggest weight belt competitors, and read online reviews, the theme of failed Velcro was consistent and clear\n\nThey set out to design the best, most functional weightlifting belt possible, while solving that main problem: How do you fix the Velcro?\nThey reached out to manufacturers and got a variety of samples\n They looked at using buckles, clasps, and a clip with teeth that dug into the belt\n They got prototypes of about five different solutions and tested them\n They also considered what type of material they would use\n The width of the belt, the shape, all of it came under scrutiny—all while sticking to their core values as a company of functional products for functional athletes\n No marketing gimmicks\n\nThey finally settled on a self-locking buckle, a slide lock that actually supports the entire pressure of the belt as opposed to the Velcro\n When they launched and marketed the product, they focused on the problem their belt would solve—the failing Velcro\n By understanding what their audience was looking for, Jason and his partner centered all their marketing material on the design difference between their belt and others\n It helped them stand out and eat away at the competition’s sales, while still keeping their prices high\n It also helped shape their reputation and started to build their brand within the space\n\nJason attributed a lot of his success to his product being different, and in bringing an obvious improvement to a well-used product in the CrossFit and weightlifting communities\n But he also benefited from relationships with influencers\n\nWhen it comes to influencers, Jason found cold calling ineffective —unless you just want to pay for a post\n “The best way is to meet people in person by going to events, having a handshake, providing some sort of value to the influencer,” he said\n “Especially if you can understand what they care about and make that personal connection\n”\nIt’s even better if you can bring the influencers into the development cycle, which is what Jason and his partner are trying to do now\n “As you build new products, the influencers give input\n What\n\n this ends up doing is creating a complete buy-in once the product launches\n”\nInfluencer events are great, but going to events in your chosen market is just as important\n “At the end of the day, you’re selling to a person,” he said\n “Just because they’re behind a computer screen doesn’t change the fact that it’s a person\n How can you really know your people if you don’t go to the events where they hang out and meet them face-to-face?”\nJason said they have faced some challenges—the constantly changing Amazon platform, initial design problems, and a change in packaging\n The new design looked great, but their manufacturer failed to mention that with the new printing process, there was an odor\n Suddenly, they started getting bad reviews about their product’s smell\n\nDespite these challenges along the way, they went from zero to $10,000 a month in two months\n They consistently grew for a year and a half before focusing on launching new products\n\n“Find one product that works, get the cash flowing, and then, as quickly as possible, start testing new products\n Double down on products that work great and get rid of products that do not,” Jason said\n “If I could have a do-over, I’d be more aggressive with the timeline than we were\n As soon as the business is self-sustaining, and there’s no out-of-pocket expenses, you should launch the next product —roughly when you’re selling $10,000 to $15,000 a month on a single product\n”\nJason and his partner both had full-time jobs when they first started the business, so their process dragged out a little bit because they were not 100 percent working on the business at the start\n As a result, it took them a little longer than twelve months to get to $1 million; instead, they were at a million in twenty-four months\n Jason left his job, working full-time on the business\n He and his partner are finally at the point where they take an owner’s draw\n\n“The money is great,” he said, “but honestly, it’s the freedom, and all the people I’ve met and built relationships with, that makes this fulfilling for me\n”\n\n9\nStep Seven: Build a Million-Dollar Brand\nRemember Dave Asprey’s fancy coffee?\nWhen Dave launched his company, Bulletproof 360, in 2013, it quickly became famous for his recommended morning brew: coffee, blended with butter and MCT oil\n It was only natural for Dave to launch his own coffee brand of organic, “upgraded” coffee as his first product\n\nHe followed up with his own line of butter and MCT oil, which helped him to establish a steady stream of revenue and raving fans\n Had he wanted to have a small, profitable coffee company, he could have stopped there\n\nBut Dave desired to be more than a coffee company; he had his sights set on becoming the go-to source for upgraded performance\n Over the next few years, Dave would release everything from supplements, to sleep induction mats, to a “whole body vibe,” to a $15,000 five-day retreat\n\nOf course, it would have been impossible for Bulletproof to do this right out of the gate\n They had to crawl before they could run\n But with a raving fan base that supports all his products, Bulletproof has the ability to release whatever products Dave is inspired to create\n\nJust like Bulletproof, your brand will be defined by the products that you release\n Your first product was your gateway; it made it easy for your audience to start their journey, and to choose you as their guide\n But to create\n  \na real brand, your follow-up products must lead the customer to the next stage of their journey\n These follow-up products will ultimately define what your company becomes; they will also lead you to cross your first million\n\nStage Three: The Gold\nWhen our first Sheer Strength product hit twenty-five sales a day, Matt and I were beside ourselves\n\nIt was a major milestone\n At the same time, we knew it was just the beginning\n If we were going to build a million-dollar business, our math told us that, at our price point, we would have to sell four products at twenty-five sales a day to get there\n\nAfter hitting twenty-five sales each day consistently, our product leveled off\n You’re always going to hit a plateau\n Luckily, that plateau is a milestone itself: That’s when you’ll know it’s time to release your second product\n\nAfter we released product two, sales started to climb quickly, much faster than they did with the first product because we already had a built-in audience of customers willing to try our second product\n In fact, our second product started out-selling product one within just a few weeks\n\nThen something weird happened\n Once the second product hit twenty-five sales a day, the first one jumped up from its plateau and began doing fifty sales a day! Sales that were previously flat had now doubled! The second product actually bumped up the first product\n\nPreviously, we had feared that the two products might take sales away from one another, but they were actually feeding one another! Why did this happen? There were a couple factors at play\n First, we had repeat customers\n\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"for sentence in df.split('.'):\n
